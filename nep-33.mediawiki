==Abstract==

One may want to charge a fee for calling one of their contract methods. Allowing non-native contracts to have <code>fixed</code> or <code>dynamic</code> pricing for methods within their contract then sendings the funds to the contract itself.

==Motivation==

Now contract owners, such as a exchange may want a way to get a little gas for sending funds to external wallets. This would allow the contract to have one or several methods to have a <code>fixed</code> price, taking a bit of GAS from transactioner for calling the a method (Much like an opcode price works). For example, a LP token maybe want you to pay a gas for withdrawing funds. Reason most LP/Fund contracts do this to pay for the LP contract pool's transaction fees for adjusting prices and other things.
